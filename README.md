# Malware Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the final year project created by(Hurricane Group) **Harsh Swaroop Dubey**, **Aditya Singh Diwakar**, **Anthoni Kindo**, and **Jagmohan Rajwade**. The project focuses on malware detection using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
Malware detection is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, as malicious software poses significant threats to computer systems and networks. Malware detection through standard, signature-based methods is getting increasingly difÔ¨Åcult since all current malware applications tend to have multiple polymorphic layers to avoid detection or to use side mechanisms to automatically update themselves to a newer version at short periods of time to avoid detection by any antivirus software.

Machine learning helps antivirus software detect new threats without relying on signatures. In the past, antivirus software relied largely on fingerprinting, which works by cross-referencing files against a huge database of known malware.

In this project, we have developed a machine learning model capable of detecting malware by analyzing various features extracted from binary files. We have used a dataset containing samples. of both malware and benign files to train and evaluate our model. The machine learning algorithms employed include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
